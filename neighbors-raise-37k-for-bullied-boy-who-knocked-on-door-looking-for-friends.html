I just wanted to see if you knew any kids around like, 11 or 12, maybe, because I need some friends. Like, really bad,” Walker says, looking at the ground.</p><p>Ray points the boy toward a house down the street where a few kids live.</p><p>“Well, umm, they’re not my friends anymore because they’re bullies to me,” Walker says.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shayden Walker went viral after his neighbor, Brennan Ray, posted a video of the boy knocking on their front door asking if they knew any kids. <span class=credit>GoFundMe</span></figure><p>The boy asks his neighbor if he has any kids, and when Ray tells him he has a 2-year-old son, Walker lights up.</p><p>“That’s great. I actually … I love 2-year-old, to be honest. They’re just the most cutest things I’ve ever known,” he says, adding that he “used to have” a 2-year-old sister.</p><p>Walker tells Ray his name, and Ray tells him he’ll say hello when he sees him in the neighborhood.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The boy asked his neighbor if he knew any 11- or 12-year-olds because he “needs friends badly.” <span class=credit>brennanray/TikTok</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Brennan Ray and his wife, Angel started a GoFundMe that raised over $37,000 for Shayden Walker. <span class=credit>brennanray/TikTok</span></figure><p>“You have a good day,” the boy says before walking away.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In a follow-up TikTok posted by Ray and his wife Angel</a> shows Walker had approached their house about a half hour earlier, but shied away.</p><p>The couple decided to launch a GoFundMe for Walker to help him make friends. The money would go toward a gaming system, school clothes and maybe even some amusement park tickets.</p><p>With an outpouring of support, they quickly blew past their initial goal of just $7,000.</p><p>All the funds will go directly to Walker’s family.</p><p>“Thank you all for your generosity and kindness! We expected to see support from this community but we’re shocked and amazed by how everyone’s shown up for Shayden,” the couple posted on the GoFundMe.</p><p>“We decided to turn off donations while we coordinate with his family, but all funds will stay in the GoFundMe account until then. We’ll keep you updated along the way. Thank you! #kindnessmatters”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaW9fo7Kqs8ebpqurXaeuqr%2FEZmpwo12bvLN5wa6jpaGVmXqju9hmrqGnXaC7sK%2FKnptmp55isbC70WajqKebnruoecWoqWaeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./neve-campbell-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Neve Campbell Net Worth - KahawaTungu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kavan-smith-net-worth-2020.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kavan Smith Net Worth 2020</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
