Bud Light was birthed after the brewery took off, using Budweiser as its flagship brand. The company got its start in 1860 after Eberhard Anheuser, a German soap maker, purchased a stake in Bavarian Brewery in St. Louis, Mo.</p><p>He later bought out the other investors, which allowed him to change the company’s name to E. Anheuser & Co.</p><p>Sometime later, Anheuser and his daughter Lilly came in contact with Adolphus Busch. Like Anheuser, Busch managed to get a foot in the brewing industry after forming a partnership with a brewing supplier. Through that, Busch became acquainted with Anheuser and went on to marry his daughter in 1861.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>After the two men began working together, Busch purchased half of the brewery, and by 1876, Budweiser had been created. In 1879, the company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association. After Anheuser died in 1880, Busch went on to head the company, serving as its president.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since its inception, Anheuser-Busch has continued to grow and partner with a number of brands including Four Peaks Brewing Co., Devils Backbone Brewing Company, Red Hook, and Virtue Cider.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">What’s the controversy with Bud Light?</h2><span id=whats-the-controversy-with-bud-light class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>On April 1, 2023, Mulvany posted a clip to Instagram in honor of her partnership with Bud Light.
