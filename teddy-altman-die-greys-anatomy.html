The Chief of Surgery collapsed at the end of Grey’s Anatomy’s two-hour Season 19 finale in a dramatic ending. <a href=#>Did Teddy Altman die on Grey’s Anatomy</a>? Here’s everything we know about the cliffhanger.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Grey’s Anatomy</a> is ABC’s hit medical drama, based in Seattle, Washington, that focuses on the lives of surgical interns, residents and attendings at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital (previously known as Seattle Grace Hospital and Seattle Grace Mercy West). Actress Kim Raver portrays Dr. Teddy Altman, the Chief of Surgery and an attending cardiothoracic surgeon at Grey Sloan. She first appeared in the medical drama in Season 6, Episode 9, “New History,” back in November 2009, then left after Season 8 and returned in Season 14. Her character is married to Owen Hunt, the Head of Trauma at Grey Sloan, and the pair met when were serving in the military together. They have two children, daughter Allison Hunt and son Leo Hunt.</p><p>At the end of the Season 19 finale, Teddy collapsed in the operating room just as she’s about to do emergency surgery. Teddy was suffering from a bad toothache all day, and she didn’t have time to go see the dentist. At one point in the episode, she asked surgical resident Dr. Levi Schmitt to look inside her mouth to see if he saw anything (but because Schmitt is not a dentist, he couldn’t help her).</p><p>When Teddy fell unconscious in the ER, Yasuda rushed to her side and was alarmed when she couldn’t find a pulse. The new interns were faced with an incomparable situation; they had to operate on Sam Sutton with supervision, who was dying on the operation table, and try to revive Teddy, who was slipping away before their eyes. Finally, the news broke to Owen that Teddy was down and he rushed to her side. When he saw that she wasn’t breathing, he tried to revive her using a defibrillator. The episode ended with Teddy’s condition unknown.</p><p>Did Teddy die on Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;and is Kim Raver leaving the beloved medical show? See the answer below.</p><h2><strong>Did Teddy Altman die on Grey’s Anatomy?</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Kim-Raver-as-Teddy-Altman-on-Greys.jpg alt="Kim Raver as Teddy Altman on Grey's Anatomy" width=1011 height=590 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Did Teddy Altman die on Grey’s Anatomy? No, but she came close. In the Season 20 premiere, viewers learned that Teddy’s toothache had was so severe that it effected her heart. Head of Cardio Winston Ndugu (Anthony Hill) was able to perform an emergency heart valve replacement, but it was a risky procedure and complications occurred. Winston noticed that Teddy had no pulse in her leg and rushed her back into surgery to remove a blood clot. Meanwhile, Owen was beating himself for giving Teddy a smoothie instead of having her toothache checked out. Teddy eventually pulled through and her leg was able to be saved. She woke up and asked “What happened?” as Owen kissed her forehead.</p><p>Although she survived, showrunner Meg Marinis told <a href=# rel=noopener>TVLine</a> ahead of the premiere that the experience “is absolutely going to change her.” She continued: “We’ve seen Owen have a life-and-death situation, but we haven’t seen Teddy recently have one. So like it would with anyone, it has an impact on her relationship with Owen, as well as with patients and how she treats other surgeons. It’s not going to be one of those things where she recovers and forgets.”</p><p>Thankfully, though, Teddy is not going anywhere anytime soon. Before the Season 19 finale even aired, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported that Kim Raver’s contract as a series regular had been renewed for Season 20, along with longtime fan favorites like James Pickens Jr., Chandra Wilson, and Raver’s on-screen husband, Kevin McKidd.</p><h2><strong>Is Kim Raver leaving Grey’s Anatomy?</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teddy-and-Owen-on-Greys-Anatomy.jpg alt="Teddy and Owen on Grey's Anatomy" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Is Kim Raver leaving Grey’s Anatomy? No, Kim Raver is not leaving&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy. Not only is she confirmed to star in the 2023-2024 season as a series regular, but in a March 2023 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>TV Insider</a>, the actress gave no indication of exiting anytime soon.</p><p>“I just am trying to stay very in the moment because I feel like I’m having such an amazing time. Because it’s such an established show, I am able to have the opportunity to expand myself as an artist. For example, getting to direct,” Raver explained to the publication. “When you’re just creating a new show and you’re in the first season, there’s so much going on trying to develop and establish that I feel very present the moment that we are in. And I love that we’re looking into Season 20, and I feel like I’m getting to expand as a creative and as an artist in the very place that I’m at.”</p><p>For Season 20, executive producer Meg Marinis took over as showrunner from Krista Vernoff, who announced that she was stepping down after Season 19. The show also said <a href=#>goodbye to Kelly McCreary as Maggie Pierce</a> in Season 19, as well as Ellen Pompeo as the one and only Meredith Grey, though she returned to the show for a guest appearance in the Season 20 premiere. <a href=# rel=noopener>Veteran Jessica Capshaw</a>, who starred as Arizona Robbins for seasons 5-14, is also set to make an appearance this season.</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy airs on ABC on Thursdays at 9/8c and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p><p><strong>Check out the&nbsp;<a href=#>real-life partners of your favorite&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy</a>&nbsp;stars in the gallery below.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuZ2eAeoCOrZydnKlirq3AzJqlZpyZmnqovsSyqmaZnpbBsLnYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mad-tongue-alberich-boss-guide-how-to-beat-the-roundtable-hold-invader-in-elden-ring.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mad Tongue Alberich Boss Guide: How to Beat the Roundtable Hold Invader in Elden Ring</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-top-5-rugby-players-of-all-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Top 5 Rugby Players of All Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
