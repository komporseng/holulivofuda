They were voted in.</p><p>While it's easy to forget or misunderstand this, during the 1932 federal elections, nearly 14 million Germans voted for Hitler, the Nazis, and fascism.</p><p>It's a dark, dirty secret of history that we don't like to acknowledge, but the rise of German fascism began with a democratic election. People came out in droves and cast their votes to give the Reichstag to the Nazis — and they really believed that they were making the right choice.</p><p>The Nazi Party succeeded by played into the country's worries. At the end of World War I, the country was crippled. They'd been forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles, including its War Guilt Clause, which put the full blame for the war squarely on Germany's shoulders — along with its expenses.</p><p>With so much debt to pay off, German money became practically worthless. Five years after the war ended, it took 4.2 trillion German marks to equal the value of one American dollar. People's life savings were so worthless that they burned them as kindling.</p><p>The Nazi Party fed upon this desperation. They promised to tear up the Treaty of Versailles, refuse to pay their debts, and take back the land that had been taken from them after the war. The Nazis were angrier and more militant than any other party out there — and as life got harder, that started to appeal to the Germans.</p><p>Then, in 1924, a war profiteering and corruption scandal in the German government between former Chancellor Gustav Bauer and the Jewish <a href=#>Barmat brothers</a> merchants brought on a whole new wave of anti-Semitism and distrust in the government.</p><p>Hitler's rage-filled ideas of racial superiority then started to seem more palatable to the people of Germany. Slowly, the fascist, racist Nazi Party seemed, to some people, like a solution to the country's problems.</p><p>By July 31, 1932, the people were angry. They were full of distrust and racial hatred, and they made their voices heard by going out to the polls and voting for the Nazi Party.</p><p>It took a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fire in the Reichstag</a>, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">death of a president</a>, and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">night of executions</a> to make the Nazis' power absolute – but that power originated with the will of the people. Democracy died and fascism rose because the people voted for it.</p><p>After this look at the Hitler election of 1932, check out these pictures of the <a href=#>Nazi propaganda machine</a> and <a href=#>life in Nazi Germany</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyptdOlnKtllaGypMDIqKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./susanna-hoffs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Susanna Hoffs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicki-minaj-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicki Minaj Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Wiki, Age &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
