He is a quarterback for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League. Previously, Georgis played for the Cleveland Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Pittsburgh Steelers. In the 2017 NFL Draft, the Steelers picked the University of Tennessee graduate.</strong></p><p>The Titans signed the 27-year-old athlete on December 21, 2022. Within a week, the quarterback threw his first professional touchdown pass against the Dallas Cowboys in his NFL debut, a 27-13 defeat. Aside from his professional career, the player is an outspoken opponent of Alopecia Areata. The athlete has had the disease since he was ten years old.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Dobbs8217s_Health_Status_Alopecia_Caused_Significant_Hair_Loss>Josh Dobbs’s Health Status: Alopecia Caused Significant Hair Loss</span></h2><p>Josh Dobbs has lived with Alopecia Areata for over two decades. Furthermore, many individuals seem to have misinterpreted the player’s hair loss as being caused by cancer. He does not have cancer, but rather Alopecia Areata, an autoimmune illness that causes significant hair loss.</p><p>Dobbs was diagnosed with the condition in third grade, when he was eight years old. In an interview, he described how the first treatments helped him grow his hair. His hairline started to recede while he was in high school. He had lost all of his brows and eyelashes by the end of high school.</p><p>Until his senior year, cortisone treatments held his alopecia at bay. To avoid hair loss, he needed cortisone injections every week. However, as time went on, his shots grew less effective. As a result, he chose to shave his head. Josh’s hair has ceased growing since then, and he has remained bald.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Dobbs_Is_An_Alopecia_Areata_Activist>Josh Dobbs Is An Alopecia Areata Activist</span></h2><p>Dobbs utilized his celebrity to raise awareness of alopecia, especially among young people. Joshua has spoken about how his family and friends have assisted him. He was also motivated by a former NBA player called Charlie Villanueva, who suffered from the same illness.</p><p>In turn, his message to the public is equally inspirational, particularly for young individuals impacted by the disease. He said you could achieve your goals without your hair. Alopecia should not be an impediment to your success. He went on to say that we live in a world dominated by social media and a preoccupation with beauty. However, if you are happy and content in your own skin, you can be successful. It doesn’t matter whether you have long or short hair at that moment.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Dobbs8217s_Family_History>Josh Dobbs’s Family History</span></h2><p>The Tennessee Titans quarterback was born on January 26, 1995, in Alpharetta, Georgia, to Stephanie and Robert Dobbs. His mother resigned from UPS as a regional manager in corporate human resources. His father, on the other hand, works as a vice president at Wells Fargo Bank.</p><p>Josh started playing competitive football when he was five years old. He attended Wesleyan School. He then enrolled in Alpharetta High School. During his high school years, he was an avid football player. The youthful quarterback passed for 3,625 yards and 29 touchdowns.</p><p>Dobbs originally committed to play collegiate football at Arizona State University. He then changed his mind about attending the University of Tennessee and continued to play. Josh also has a bachelor’s degree in aeronautical engineering. The quarterback won the institution’s Torchbearer Award in 2017, the highest honor bestowed to undergraduate students in appreciation of their accomplishments in the community and the classroom.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Lucy Letby Pregnant 2023?
