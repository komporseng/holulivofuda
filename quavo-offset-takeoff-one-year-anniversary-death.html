He was arrested in December 2022 based on a reconstruction of the incident per video and ballistics evidence, but his lawyers are telling a different story.</p><p>“He maintains his innocence,” defense attorney Letitia Quinones-Hollins told <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> about the incident last year. “We do believe that he has a valid self-defense claim. I don’t think they can say with any degree of certainty that it was Patrick who actually fired the shot that took TakeOff’s life.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>She added: “There was someone else who started the shooting, it was not Patrick Clark. He was in the same position that TakeOff was in, he was trying to get out of there alive as well. He didn’t have anything to do with the argument that occurred. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when people started firing weapons.”</p><p>With Clark’s next court date scheduled for early next year, Quinones-Hollins believes that the trial will most likely begin in the second half of 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miorpmmpHqwssWsnK1lpJa4prvFn2SoppVixqat0WaYp6aZq7Kzv8CrsGaclZbBqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-don-dada-mike-emilio-remix-by-mike-emilio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Don Dada (Mike Emilio Remix) by Mike Emilio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./moms-friend-who-allegedly-bought-5-year-old-kamarie-holland-to-rape-kill-says-hes-insane-court-crime-online.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Moms Friend Who Allegedly Bought 5-year-old Kamarie Holland to Rape &amp;amp; Kill Says Hes I</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
