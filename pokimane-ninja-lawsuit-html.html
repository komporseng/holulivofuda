The <a href=# rel=follow>ban was not lifted</a>, just so you know.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That was the last anyone had heard from Ninja on the matter until he said in a now-deleted tweet that "All will be explained," hinting that the supposed feud between arguably the two biggest streamers on Twitch would be sorted out.&nbsp;</p><p>But then, <a href=# rel=follow>nothing came of Ninja's premonition</a>. A day later, Pokimane clapped back, saying,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I thought it was kind of interesting that Ninja was like, 'Everything will be clarified.' And then he woke up the next day and played Fortnite for 7 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>From her vantage point, she believed that Ninja and JiDion shared much of the same viewership, and flipping sides at this point would mean that Ninja would lose viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ninja Lied to JiDion's Fans</h2><p>In response to Pokimane calling out Ninja, she got a <a href=# rel=follow>DM from his wife</a>, Jessica. Jessica&nbsp;explicitly stated that Ninja had lied to get out of a tricky situation.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Ninja had clearly said that he had sent a text to his representative at Twitch to pull on some strings to get JiDion back on board.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Turns out, Ninja never sent that text and simply lied to stop the harassment he'd been receiving from JiDion's fans.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Pokimane leaked Jessica Blevin's DM </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Moreover, Jessica claimed that Pokimane was well aware of what had happened and was garnering hate and defaming her husband's good name.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jessica accused Pokimane of "actively bringing harassment" to Ninja and herself "at the highest level.&nbsp;</p><p>To top it all off, Jessica said that Team Ninja was considering everything an act of defamation of character and very seriously so. She added that a lawsuit was on the table and&nbsp;the legal team would be involved in the matter.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKifoLaurc2eZKehnp%2BubrjAsKquoaRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cynthia-alksne-wiki-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Cynthia Alksne?
