Ewan reportedly separated from Eve in May 2017, which raised eyebrows as he was rumored to be in a relationship with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fargo </a>co-star at the time, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mary Elizabeth Winstead</strong></a>, who had just announced her own split from her husband of seven years, <strong>Riley Stearns</strong>.

When she sees them hurting over this divorce, her response is to get angry and lash out at Mary Elizabeth.” Even Mary Elizabeth’s ex Riley <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appeared to diss her</a> after their divorce.
