Danny was just a guy put in a no-win situation, Kitty says in a long letter published on Vice&nbsp;(caution: this excerpt contains graphic language):</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>What is Danny supposed to do? The girl was at mouth-to-d*** level already and to push her away, he would’ve had to either pushed her face or kicked her, and even the most gentle of either motion would immediately be labeled “abuse” by anyone watching. Guys pushing girls is not a good look when people are taking photos. So what was Danny supposed to do, other than back away, which he did? And if he&nbsp;<i>had</i>&nbsp;figured out a way to gently push the girl off him immediately without looking like he was smacking her in the face, he’s faced with attacks on his masculinity by every douchebro in the building. Yo dude, you don’t want your d*** sucked, bro? Are you gay? Haha you’re gay you don’t want girls to suck your d*** haha gay dude bro man swag! And that’s a rapper’s literal nightmare.</p><h3>Danny Brown: Is He Regretful?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kitty’s points on how Danny would’ve been attacked even more had he physically pushed a girl and how avoiding sexual situations is very taboo in hip-hop culture are both valid. But if those were the deep-seated reasons for why Danny found himself in this obscene situation, you wouldn’t think he’d be celebrating it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Which is what he did when another rapper,&nbsp;<strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong>, asked him if the whole thing actually happened on Twitter. Brown confirmed it and then added that he “didn’t miss one bar bruh bruh.” The tweet has since been deleted, which could mean that he actually&nbsp;does feel some sense of regret and/or shame, but Danny’s actual feelings are still murky. Can we all just agree that letting people on stage is a bad idea altogether — let’s just avoid these situations from happening, Danny and Kitty!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>What do you think of Danny Brown’s onstage “altercation?” Do you agree with Kitty, or think she’s just rationalizing?
