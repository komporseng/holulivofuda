The man has seen a lot of success in the field as he is mainly recognized as one of the founders of Facebook. Let's learn about his wife, Elaine.</p><h2>Married To An Entrepreneur Eduardo Saverin</h2><p>Elaine Andriejanssen fell in love with an entrepreneur from Brazil. The man who swept her off her feet is Eduardo Saverin. These two tied the knot on <strong>June 25, 2015</strong>. <i>So, how did these two love stories start?&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/4/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(1)-1670143882201.jpg><p>The Indonesian-Chinese woman and Brazilian man's love story started in Massachusetts in their college days. The two dated for a while before realizing they were the one for each other. They took their relationship to the next level by officially engaging with each other on <strong>March 27, 2014</strong>. That's the same month <a href=# rel=nofollow>Savannah Guthrie married </a><a href=# rel=nofollow>Michael Feldman</a>.</p><p>The romantic couple Elaine&nbsp; & Eduardo has been living a successful married life since then. They have not made their marriage a subject of drama for the media. The two are living in Singapore.</p><h2>Net Worth & Earnings of Elaine's Husband</h2><p>Elaine Andriejanssen must have the best life. Not everyone has money to afford things they want, but her husband is a successful entrepreneur and one rich man. Elaine, herself hasn't disclosed her wealth.</p><p>However, her husband, Eduardo Saverin, has a massive net worth. He is a billionaire with a net worth of <strong>$13.4 billion</strong>. <i>Bloomberg</i> claims that Meta is where the majority of the wealth comes from. His net worth alone makes them one of the wealthiest celebrities couple.</p><p>The co-founder of Facebook Saverin spent <strong>$167 million</strong>&nbsp;for a home on two acres in Singapore in 2019. There is a pool, a tennis court, and a large yard.

The two have been in a successful relationship for a long time now. And they haven't let the media tell negative stories about their love life. But, there was a time when the media tried to create a fake account about her husband's marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/4/080609015007singapore%20(1)-1670144231564.jpg><p>The story was that Eduardo was going to marry the Miss Singapore Universe <strong>Rachel Kum</strong>. Per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mara Siegler from <i>PageSix</i></a>, <i>Glamurama</i> had reported in <strong>2015</strong> that he was going to marry Rachel on <strong>June 27</strong>. It turned about to be just a fake story as all of the rumors were cleared to the media by his spokesperson Tom Goodman. He said:</p><p>He has never dated Miss Singapore and never invested in her company. He is not marrying her.&nbsp;</p><h2>Elaine Works As An Analyst</h2><p>The celebrity wife Elaine is more than just a pretty face and a wife of a famous man. She may not have disclosed her wealth, but we know about her work. So, if you didn't know, she works as an analyst.&nbsp;</p><p>Eduardo's wife is a Quantitative Research Analyst, to be more specific. The company she works for is Franklin Investments. There is also another famous story on the internet: she works for EE Capital now, but there aren't enough sources to back it up.&nbsp;</p><p>It is believed that wife of the Facebook's Co-founder Eduardo, Andriejanssen &nbsp;now works as the Executive Chairman at EE Capital in Singapore and has been working there since 2016. However, the information remains unconfirmed.</p><h2>Some Info On Eduardo Saverin</h2><p>Eduardo Luiz Saverin is a celebrated name in the entrepreneurial world. And why not?

His LinkedIn says that through this company, he has worked with many entrepreneurs and gained a lot of success.&nbsp;</p><h2>Studies At Tufts University</h2><p>Elaine Andriejanssen works as a research analyst.

He was also the first investor in the company. But he is no longer working at the company. But why?</p><p>Almost everyone has heard of the famous story that Mark Zuckerberg got rid of him from the company. So, why did one best friend's relationship end up like this?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/4/mark-zuckerberg-at-f8-410f7982753d4ed8825c20f89e83acf5%20(1)-1670144645659.jpg><p>Even though many people believe that Zuckerberg's greed was the reason that Eduardo was kicked out of the company. As per the face of the company, Zuck himself, Eduardo, was not doing his work and hence, was fired from the company. He refused to cooperate with the team and didn't go to Palo Alto with the rest of the group.</p><h2>Eduardo Loves Playing Chess</h2><p>Eduardo Saverin is a billionaire, and it wouldn't take a lot to guess that he must be a busy man.

He gets competitive and is good at the popular board game. In fact, at the young age of <strong>13</strong>, he won a massive match against a professional, and <i>The International Chess Magazine</i> even covered the incident.</p><h2>Andrew Garfield Played Him On The Social Network</h2><p>The famous 2010 film <i>The Social Network</i> shows the story of the origin of tech giant Facebook. Based on a true story, the movie had some excellent actors portraying real-life people. In the case of Eduardo, he was played by Andrew Garfield.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>There were many things that the movie got right about Eduardo, but some fictional stories also showed up in the film. Popular YouTube channel <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Watchmojo</i></a> has also covered it. They mentioned that movie scenes of Eduardo freezing the bank account were actual, whereas being Zuck's only friend and feeding meat to a chicken were made-up stories.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eduardo Is No Longer An American Citizen</h2><p>Elaine's husband Eduardo made the news in <strong>2012</strong> when he gave up on his American citizenship. When the news broke out, the consensus among ordinary people was that he was just another capitalist trying to avoid taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>But Elaine's husband has said that the reason he quit his US citizenship had nothing to do with that but rather because he loved Singapore and wanted to live there. He currently lives with his wife in Singapore and will likely grow his family there.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more exciting celebrity bios.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6jmqGemnqiusOroJ6ikaPAtLHN</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jane-asher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jane Asher</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./parade-broadway-review-flawed-musical-gets-heartfelt-revival.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Flawed musical gets heartfelt revival</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
