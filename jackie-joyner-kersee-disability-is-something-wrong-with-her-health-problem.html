Health Problem</h2><p><strong>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</strong>, a four-time World Championship gold winner, was diagnosed with asthma while a UCLA student-athlete in the early 1980s.&nbsp;Asthma might be deemed a health concern rather than a handicap until it significantly interferes with one’s everyday life to fulfill the requirements for impairment.&nbsp;Joyner kept her health problems secret from her coach, fearing it would jeopardize her athletic future.
