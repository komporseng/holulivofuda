They both apologize to each other for the mishap after the Madonna concert. They realize they never wanted to breakup and reconcile with a few “I Love yous” and a hot make-out session.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Unfortunately, Carrie’s happiness is short lived. Maggie (<strong>Katie Findlay</strong>) has a slip of the tongue and admits that Sebastian has been keeping a secret from Carrie — her dad’s been seeing a new lady friend. Carrie confronts Sebastian, but he admits to only wanting to protect her. She goes on about how maybe they’re too different to be together — she over thinks and he doesn’t think enough. Carrie calls off their date to the prom.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Following this reveal, Maggie apologizes to Sebastian for letting their secret out. He’s not having it and chooses to give Maggie a taste of her own medicine. He tells her that Walt likes boys. (More on that later.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Instead of going to prom, Carrie takes Walt (<strong>Brendan Dooling</strong>) to New York City for Larissa’s (<strong>Freema Agyeman</strong>) going away party. She’ll be gone all summer long. Walt hangs with&nbsp;Bennet (<strong>Jake Robinson</strong>), while Carrie has girl talk with Larissa. Her mentor soon snaps some sense into her and Carrie realizes that she is “madly in love” with Sebastian. Upon this realization, she rushes home to meet him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>However, Sebastian was busy getting it on with Maggie at a random bar, as they were both sad and depressed. (Alcohol and depression never mix well, people!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When Carrie arrives at Sebastian’s, he lets her in. She wants to have sex, but Sebastian asks to just lay in bed together all night long. She agrees. Carrie heads home, super happy, but soon finds Maggie at her door.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Maggie spills the beans and tells Carrie the truth about her hookup with Sebastian. She cries to Carrie, telling her how she was up all night in agony, etc. Carrie basically tells her to shut it and that she’s an attention-seeker. For now, their friendship is no more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Carrie then ignores Sebastian’s calls, and when he knocks on her door, Dorrit tells him Carrie’s not home.</p><h3>Walt Is Forced Out Of The Closet</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>Upon Sebastian leaking the news to Maggie, she bum rushes Walt at the diner and calls him a “homo!” Clearly, Maggie is not happy with the news of Walt’s homosexuality. She feels betrayed and says she’s disgusted that she ever dated him. Carrie tries defending Walt, but Maggie is too busy screaming in her face as well. Apparently, Maggie puts the blame on Carrie for keeping Walt’s sexuality a secret. (I am definitely a fan of Carrie and Walt’s friendship. I only hope they stick together in the future!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In New York City, Walt kisses Bennet. While Bennet admits to wanting to kiss more, he tells Walt they’ll have to wait until the end of the summer when Walt turns 18. (I’ll definitely be tuning in come September for more hot Walt and Bennet action!)</p><h3>A ‘Sex and the City’ Character Is Introduced</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>It’s during a conversation between Walt and Bennet that we hear the sweet sound of a Sex and the City character! Bennet admits that his roommate’s name is Stanford! Can you believe it?! The prequel will finally meet up with the original series! Now, that alone, is a reason to tune into season two!</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Were you satisfied with the season finale? Do you think Carrie and Sebastian will get back together?</p><h3>WATCH: ‘The Carrie Diaries’ Season Finale End Scene — ‘Kiss Yesterday Goodbye’</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>— Chris Rogers</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow<br>@ChrisRogers86</a></p><h3>More ‘Carrie Diaries’ News:</h3><li>‘The Carrie Diaries’ Recap: Walt Opens Up About His Secret Crush</li><li>‘The Carrie Diaries’ Recap: Sebastian Compromises Carrie’s Future</li><li>‘The Carrie Diaries’ Recap: Carrie’s Secret Life Gets Exposed</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH11e49xZq2glWKwor7RopxmnJmWv6qx0maqnpmjpLtussinmKWdXaeypK3PZqqempGowaqtzWaaoZ2RqcBuu81mmpqqop6ybrnAoJ6inV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-everett-scott-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Everett Scott Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-corey-scherer-dating-anyone-in-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Corey Scherer Dating Anyone In 2021?
