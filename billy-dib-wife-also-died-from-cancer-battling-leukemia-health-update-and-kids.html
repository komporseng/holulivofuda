He also stated that he battled cancer and conquered it in 2022.</strong></p><p>Australian professional boxer Billy Dib, also known as Bilal Dib, competes internationally. He became famous after defeating Jacob “The Flamingo” NG last night, who had been disqualified for pinning the veteran to the ground in a way akin to wrestling.</p><p>Billy Dib, a former two-time world champion, had threatened to retire if he couldn’t beat Jacob NG, a lightweight prospect touted as one of Australia’s most intriguing with a 15-0 (11KO) record.</p><p>Although NG is nine years his junior and is 11 cm taller, the exciting battle featured many exciting exchanges between equally matched opponents for most of the action.</p><p>When the two engaged in a clinch in the sixth round on the Gold Coast, NG was able to raise his opponent and knock him to the ground, sparking the start of a furious rivalry.</p><h2><span id=Billy_Dib8217s_wife_passed_away_due_to_cancer_and_leukemia>Billy Dib’s wife passed away due to cancer and leukemia</span></h2><p>Boxing great Billy Dib was inconsolable as he lay his wife and “angel” Sara to rest.</p><p>Just eight weeks after receiving a leukemia diagnosis, Sara Selim Dib died unexpectedly on Saturday night at the age of 21 from complications related to her treatment.</p><p>The pair had intended to be married in December, but six weeks ago, after discovering she had cancer, they conducted a civil ceremony.</p><p>We belong to God and shall return to God, Dib said on Facebook. At 11.30 yesterday night, my heart stopped beating. Sara Selim Dib is my soul partner, dearest friend, everything, and my eternal angel.</p><p>The task of burying his spouse lay before the 37-year-old in agony after that. According to Islamic custom, the dead must be buried 24 hours after passing away.</p><p>Sara was buried in Rookwood Cemetery in the presence of several friends and family members from the Selim and Dib families after a short ceremony at Lakemba Mosque.</p><p>Former world champion boxer Dib was inconsolable and unable to speak after fighting with blood in his eyes and broken hands. He had never come up against anything as debilitating as melancholy.</p><p>His elder brother Jihad Dib, the state MP for Lakemba, stated, “We have been tremendously moved and overwhelmed by the well-wishes we’ve received since Sara’s awful demise.</p><p>A blood clot in Sara’s brain was caused by one of her cancer drugs soon after the interview, however. The physicians were unable to rescue her since she suffered a stroke and a brain tumor.</p><p>While Sara was in the hospital, Dib spent her final nights sleeping on the hospital floor and told her in three days what he had been meaning to say to her all along.</p><h2><span id=Update_on_Billy_Dib8217s_health>Update on Billy Dib’s health</span></h2><p>Former boxing world champion Billy Dib has posted many somber pictures from the hospital as he prepares to begin treatment after a terrible diagnosis.</p><p>Following extensive testing on a 5 cm tumor, the 37-year-old Australian tweeted on social media this week to alert his 50,000 followers that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive and unusual type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>He had disclosed his “frightening” diagnosis of a cancerous stomach tumor a few weeks before.</p><p>He had surgery for what his doctors first believed to be colon cancer only a few weeks ago, and on Thursday at Sydney’s Westmead Hospital, he will start chemotherapy.</p><p>But he didn’t find out he had Burkitt’s lymphoma until this past week. Dib posted photographs of himself with his kid and wife, Berry, as well as various video clips from the hospital on Wednesday.</p><p>He tweeted, “I can’t wait to wake up from this nightmare called Cancer.” I just want to spend the rest of my days taking care of my beautiful wife and my kid.</p><h2><span id=How_many_children_does_Billy_Dib_have>How many children does Billy Dib have?</span></h2><p>Australian boxer Billy Dib and his new wife had a kid four years after losing his first marriage to cancer.</p><p>The former featherweight world champion and his third wife, Berry, announced the birth of Laith Bilal Dib over the weekend.</p><p>“To say we are overjoyed would be an understatement,” we said. Dib said, “We sincerely appreciate this magnificent blessing,” on Instagram.</p><p>Dib posted pictures of the smiling parents cradling the baby while holding one of their fingers in the little hand of the newborn.</p><p>The boxer and Berry, who wed in 2018, celebrated their first wedding anniversary on April 29. “Today marks one year since Berry and I were married. I will always be grateful that you are in my life, he stated.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Maxwell Bradley Garrett, Ceren Alkac, and Camaron Engel."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":66}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/maxwell-bradley-garrett/"}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ceren-alkac/"}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":"https://popularbio.com/camaron-engels/"}{"1":66}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Camaron Engel</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Boxer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Australian Cossack Arrested?
