The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, 28, is now a Super Bowl winner after his team defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in February of 2023 — despite an ankle injury. His home life is complete, as he married high school sweetheart <strong>Brittany Mahomes&nbsp;</strong>in March of 2022, and they share two children — daughter<strong> Sterling</strong>, 2, and son <strong>Bronze</strong>, 1.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But before all the fame and fortune, the NFL star was a kid with big athletic dreams being raised by loving parents in Texas. Here’s what to know about Patrick’s parents, <strong>Randi Martin</strong> and <strong>Pat Mahomes</strong>.</p><h2 id=pats-a-former-athlete>Pat’s a Former Athlete</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Pat Mahomes clearly inspired his famous son — the Texas native was an MLB pitcher for the better part of a decade, from 1992-2003, and played for the Pittsburg Pirates and New York Mets, among others. Pat was inducted into the Sioux Falls Canaries Hall of Fame in 2019.</p><h2 id=randi-works-as-an-event-planner>Randi Works as an Event Planner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/patrick-mahomes-parents-ss-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, Randi, also a Texas native from the small town of Troup, works as an event planner at Hollytree Country Club.
