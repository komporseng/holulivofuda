According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Charles’ net worth is as high as $2 million, an amount earned through his successful career, only active since 2015.</p><h3>James Charles Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>James is a native of Bethlehem, and has recently matriculated from Bethlehem Central High School. He started his YouTube channel in December 2015, but before he realized he had a talent for different make-up settings, James did hairstyles for friends and local people he already knew. He came to realize his extra talent when one of his friends asked him to do her make-up when she was late for an appointment at a professional makeup artist. His friend was rather satisfied with the outcome, and James began slowly to hone his skills, and so establish his net worth.</p><p>He came straight to his parents about wanting to become a makeup artist, and with their full support and help, opened a makeup studio in the basement of their house. He then launched his YouTube channel in 2015, and soon&nbsp; amassed almost two million subscribers. So far he has posted more than 70 makeup tutorial videos on his channel, which have garnered more than 95 million views, which have significantly increased his popularity, and net worth as well. He gained attention for his tutorials from not only common people, but also television personalities, including <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>, which resulted in his guest appearance in her show in 2016, which also contributed to both his net worth and popularity.</p><p>In recent years, James was approached by cosmetics brand CoverGirl, and became its first male spokes-model, gracing events with the ambassador of CoverGirl, <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>. Thanks to such an accomplishment, James became involved in a new engagement, as he will be the face of SoLashy! By BlastPro Mascara, which will also benefit his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, James is openly gay, coming out back in 2012. However, there is no information as to whether James has a relationship, or has ever been in one.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOYpp2jYrCprdGlnKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jooj-natu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jooj Natu- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./j-cole-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J.
