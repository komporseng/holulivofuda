I've learned from that spotlight over the past eight years.</p><p>"I've also, if I'm being honest, been burned by it, too, as we all have.</p><p>"There was no way in hell I was going to share the biggest joy of my world with anyone. Halo was my gift. He is the greatest blessing, and I had no obligation to expose him, me, or my family to that."</p><p>The Color Purple actress then blamed the "state of the world" and hinted that the magnitude of social media was all behind her reasoning to keep things private.</p><p>She said: "With the state of the world and the place it is in with men trying to force their will on our bodies, no one on social media, and for damn sure, no one on the planet, was going to tell me what to do with my body or what to share with the world."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Celebrities Who Had Kids Young</h2><p>When it comes to parenthood, Hollywood is home to moms and dads of all ages.
