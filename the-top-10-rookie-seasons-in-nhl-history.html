The performances of these players have been intriguing for fans and crucial to the league, altering their careers heavily. Here's a complete examination of the top 10 rookie campaigns ever in NHL history, their excellence, and, on many occasions, dominance, accomplishments, and lasting imprints.</span></p><h3><b>1. Terry Sawchuk, Detroit Red Wings (1950-51)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Playing all 70 regular season games, Sawchuk had a record of 44-13-13 with an unprecedented for-the-time GAA of only (1.99), and an even more impressive eleven shutouts, earning him both the Calder Trophy as top rookie in the NHL and getting voted to both first-team All-Star positions. Over his storied career, Sawchuk would find success in the form of multiple Stanley Cups and Vezina Trophy victories to become one of the arguably greatest ACHL netminders ever.</span></p><h3><b>2. Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins (2005-06)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2005-06 season, Sidney Crosby established himself as a generational talent, towering over his nearest teammate with 39 goals and 102 points scored. Though he was the Calder Trophy runner-up, Crosby's rookie season foreshadowed his greatness to come and displayed that while just 18 years of age, he could already compete with the upper-echelon NHL players. However, his lasting impact on the league and the Pittsburgh Penguins cannot be overlooked as he guided them through multiple championships to become the name you will see in NHL history books for years to come.</span></p><h3><b>3. Bobby Orr, Boston Bruins (1966-67)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Bobby Orr changed the role defensemen play in the NHL as a rookie with the Boston Bruins during their Stanley Cup-winning 1966-67 season. Orr had a strong offensive season with 13 goals and 28 assists for 41 points and an incredible plus-30 rating. He broke the mold for what was expected of a defenseman. He would have an illustrious career with multiple Stanley Cups and many individual awards, making him one of the best, if not the best, defenseman in history.</span></p><h3><b>4. Alex Ovechkin, Washington Capitals (2005-06)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Drafted first overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, Ovechkin had an impressive debut season as a forward with the Washington Capitals. That year, Ovechkin exploded for 52 goals and 106 points en route to the Calder Trophy and a spot on the NHL's all-rookie team.</span></p><h3><b>5. Teemu Selanne,&nbsp; Winnipeg Jets (1992-93)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In 1992-93, Teemu Selanne burst onto the scene in his rookie season with the Winnipeg Jets. His 76 goals and 132 points set records for a rookie, which not only earned him the Calder Trophy.</span></p><h3><b>6. Mario Lemieux, Pittsburgh Penguins (1984-85)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Lemieux needed only 73 games to score a rookie record since eclipsed by Teemu Selanne's 43 goals and set up 57 others for an NHL best since Gordie Howe's 100 points, earning the Calder Trophy as the top rookie. His impact on the then-young Penguins and his legacy in NHL lore would only grow, though, as Lemieux became one of the most beloved names ever to play that game.</span></p><h3><b>7.</b><b>Ray Bourque,&nbsp;</b><b>Boston Bruins (1979-80)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In his first year in the League (1979-80), Boston Bruins rookie Ray Bourque provided a blueprint of playing both ends of the ice from the blue line. Bourque, who, in addition to leading all CHL defensemen with 17 goals, 48 assists, and sixty-five points, posted an eye-popping plus-52 rating. He would win multiple Norris Trophies and establish himself as one of the greatest defenders in NHL history, but not before his mark had been left on the Bruins and the league.</span></p><h3><b>8. Dale Hawerchuk, Winnipeg Jets (1981-82)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding exceptional rookie campaigns, little compares to what Dale Hawerchuk did for the Winnipeg Jets in 1981-82. The 45 goals and 103 points he scored in his rookie season alone earned him the Calder Trophy while also illustrating just how skilled and dominant McDavid could be on a nightly basis. After his rookie season, Hawerchuk was one of the Jets' go-to performers and made a lasting impression after boosting their scoring output on an NHL rink.</span></p><h3><b>9. Auston Matthews, Toronto Maple Leafs (2016-17)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Auston Matthews epically burst onto the scene during his first regular season with the Toronto Maple Leafs back in 2016-17 when he scored a whopping 40 goals and totaled 68 points, both of which were records for any rookie. Matthews' presence on the Maple Leafs and in the league remains profound, as he is a central figure to both his team's championship ambitions.</span></p><h3><b>10. Patrick Kane, Chicago Blackhawks (2007-08)</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">When Patrick Kane burst onto the NHL scene as a rookie with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2007-08, his skill and playmaking ability stood out. Kane finished with 21 goals and 51 assists for a rookie-best 72 points, which resulted in him earning the Calder Trophy as the top rookie.</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The ten best rookie seasons in NHL history come together here as a meeting point of extraordinary talent, performance, and lasting legacy left in the game. These exceptional rookies dazzle fans with their talent and dominance and leave an impregnable mark on the league and future generations of players. While we honor the milestones of these athletes, their beginnings remind us that greatness in the National Hockey League is a constant.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miloaRfqbWmedOop2ZpYGK%2FsLvKopxmq5WWwLC60magp2WenblutMisq6iqqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-tab-by-stick-to-your-guns.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>AMBER TAB by Stick to Your Guns</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mina-kimes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mina Kimes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
