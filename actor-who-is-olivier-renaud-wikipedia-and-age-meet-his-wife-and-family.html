Meet Steve Wrigh’s Children Lucy & Tom: Is The Radio 2 Personality Dating Anyone? Steve Wrigh’s Age, Wife, Children, Family, Net worth, Biography And Wiki</strong></p><p>Steve Wright is a well-known radio personality and disc jockey in the United Kingdom. He is also credited with being the one who brought the bizarre, multi-personality zoo format to British radio. He has spent the better part of his professional life working for various radio stations.</p><p>Wright presently hosts his weekday mid-afternoon show Steve Wright in the Afternoon and his Sunday Love Songs weekend mid-morning show on BBC Radio 2, the most popular radio station in the UK and one of the BBC’s national stations. Both shows air from midday to three o’clock in the afternoon.</p><p>The well-known radio personality started his career with the BBC in the early 1970s as a returns clerk at the Gramophone Library located at Egton House in London, which is located right next to the Programming House. In 1976, he resigned from the company and began working in radio broadcasting alongside Mike Read at Thames Valley Radio Radio 210.</p><p>He is the recipient of a number of prizes, including the Smash Hits Best DJ of the Year award and the 1994 Daily Mirror Readers Poll award. In recognition of his work as a radio host, he was given the TRIC Personality of the Year award in 1998. When he joined BBC Radio 1 for the first time in 1980, he was assigned a position for the Saturday evening broadcast; later, he moved to the Saturday morning broadcast.</p><p>In a similar manner, he joined BBC Radio 2 in March 1996 and began anchoring Steve Wright’s Saturday Show shortly thereafter.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57538 alt="Steve Wright" width=225 height=225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Steve-Wright-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57538 class=wp-caption-text>Steve Wright</p><h2><span id=Lucy_and_Tom_are_the_Names_of_the_Presenter8217s_Children_at_the_BBC_Steve_Wright>Lucy and Tom are the Names of the Presenter’s Children at the BBC, Steve Wright.</span></h2><p>Together with his first wife, Cyndi Robinson, Steve Wright is the father of two children: a son named Tom and a daughter named Lucy.</p><p>Before the couple divorced in 1999, the radio star had been married to Cyndi for a total of 12 years. The divorce between Steve and his wife was finalized in the same year that the initial petition for divorce was submitted.</p><p>Following the completion of the divorce proceedings, Cyndi was awarded exclusive custody of the two children. After that, she was responsible for bringing up their two gorgeous children on her own. Cyndi, on the other hand, has a more low-key lifestyle and keeps information about her and Steve’s children private from the general public.</p><p>When it comes to Steve’s origins, Greenwich, which is located in South London, is where he was born. He was the oldest son in his family and had the ambition to pursue a career in the entertainment industry from a very young age. In addition to being a tailor, his father, Richard Wright, was the proprietor of Burton’s shop in Trafalgar Square. Wright was a shy child who never really showed his potential academically.</p><p>His education was completed at Eastwood High School for Boys, which is located in the town of Southend-on-Sea in the county of Essex.</p><h2><span id=Cyndi_Robinson_the_exe-wife_of_Steve_Wright_who_is_she_Does_He_Currently_Have_Any_Girlfriend>Cyndi Robinson, the exe-wife of Steve Wright, who is she?

They share parental responsibilities for two children between them. A once-joyful couple eventually decided to end their marriage and filed for divorce in 1999; the divorce was finalized in the same year, and his wife Cyndi was awarded sole custody of their children as a result of the proceedings.</p><p>Since the termination of his marriage, the famous DJ from the radio station has been living on his own, and he neither has nor has had a girlfriend to this day.</p><p>Wright was a radio host for BBC Radio 1 and was a member of his Afternoon Posse, which was responsible for several songs that topped the charts in the UK.
