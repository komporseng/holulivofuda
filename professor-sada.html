Her counterpart in <a href=# title="Pokémon Scarlet and Violet">Pokémon Violet</a> is <a href=# title="Professor Turo">Professor Turo</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_core_series_games>In the core series games</span></h2><p>Ten years before the events of Pokémon Scarlet, Professor Sada was part of the team that explored the <a href=# title=Paldea>Great Crater of Paldea</a>, setting up four <a href=# title="Area Zero">Research Stations</a> and the <a href=# title="Zero Lab">Zero Lab</a> in <a href=# title="Area Zero">Area Zero</a>. One day she ended up finding herself in <a href=# title="Crystal Pool">an unfamiliar place</a>, where <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Player>a child</a> gave her <a href=# title="Briar's Book">a white volume</a>, which would help her during her research. Sada was able to develop a prototype for the <a href=# title="Tera Orb">Tera Orb</a>, earning her corporate backing for her projects and allowing her to set up a second laboratory in a lighthouse near Cabo Poco. Furthermore, she was able to harness more of the <a href=# title="Terastal energy">unstable energy</a>, despite concern from her funders, and moved the majority of her research back to the Zero Lab. Sada, fascinated with the idea of Pokémon from other ages, succeeded in developing a <a href=# title="Time machine">time machine</a> that would allow her to reach out to <a href=# title="Paradox Pokémon">Paradox Pokémon</a>, Pokémon from either ancient points in the timeline, or from different timelines, by transporting <a href=# title="Poké Ball">Poké Balls</a> there and then bringing them back to her. These included <a href=# title="Koraidon (Pokémon)">Koraidon</a>, a Pokémon extremely similar to <a href=# title="Cyclizar (Pokémon)">Cyclizar</a>. Additionally, a former associate of Sada had begun expecting her child.</p><p>However, Sada began to become obsessed with her research, continuing the influx of Paradox Pokémon into the modern day in her pursuit of a paradise for her family. Not long after <a href=# title=Arven>Arven</a> was born, Arven's father abandoned Sada, driving her deeper into her work and ironically causing her to begin neglecting the very family she had sought to build her paradise for. Arven ended up growing up in the lighthouse laboratory on <a href=# title="Poco Path">Poco Path</a> on his own, never seeing or connecting with Sada due to the latter's newfound devotion to the Tera Project. This estrangement was intensified by Sada's search for a more suitable assistant, leading to her creating an <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> copy of herself using the Zero Lab's crystals to double productivity, as humanity does not possess the knowledge to develop a sophisticated AI in the time period the game takes place in, which is why the AI cannot leave Area Zero. Together, they were able to transport a second, more aggressive Koraidon to the present day, in hopes that the two Koraidon could survive and thrive in their new surroundings. At some point, Sada also developed the <a href=# title="Poké Ball">Poké Ball</a> Lock System, an ID-based defense mechanism for her lab.</p><p>Sada was determined to maintain her dream of past and present Pokémon existing in harmony. Unfortunately, Sada's research was cut short when she attempted to stop a territorial battle between the two Koraidon, defending the passive one and taking a mortal blow from the aggressive one. This also led to the destruction of Research Station No. 4, and Sada eventually passed away, leaving her AI to manage the remnants of her work in her place. However, the AI did not agree with accepting the ecological consequences of Sada's dream, and began impersonating her, reaching out to Sada's associates in hopes of finding a way to end the Tera Project once and for all.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Path_of_Legends>Path of Legends</span></h3><p>The AI first contacts the <a href=# title="Player character">player</a> when they enter the <a href=# title="Naranja Academy">Naranja Academy</a> for the first time, impersonating Sada and asking them to take care of the <a href=# title="Koraidon (game)">Koraidon</a> that was once under her possession. Throughout the game, the AI frequently contacts the player as Koraidon gradually regains the powers it once lost. Once Koraidon is fully powered, the AI asks the player to travel to Sada's laboratory at the Great Crater of Paldea.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=The_Way_Home>The Way Home</span></h3><p>As the player, <a href=# title=Nemona>Nemona</a>, <a href=# title=Arven>Arven</a>, and <a href=# title=Penny>Penny</a> traverse the area to reach Sada's laboratory, they discover the history of the two Koraidon and Sada's time machine in <a href=# title="Area Zero journals">notebooks</a> left behind in each research station.</p><p>At the <a href=# title="Zero Lab">Zero Lab</a>, the AI reveals its nature to the player and the fate that befell its creator. While Sada wished to let Pokémon of the past keep entering the modern day through the time machine, the AI refuses to let the <a href=# title=Paldea>Paldea</a> region's ecosystem be ruined by these time-displaced Pokémon and asks for the player's help in shutting down the time machine. The AI is, however, programmed to protect the time machine, so the player is forced to battle it and the Paradox Pokémon it wields against the AI's will.</p><p>After the AI is defeated, the security system initiates the <b>Paradise Protection Protocol</b> (Japanese: <b><span class=explain title=らくえんぼうえい>楽園防衛</span>プログラム</b> <i>Paradise Defense Program</i>), which sends out the AI's Koraidon, and activates the Poké Ball Lock System, preventing the player from using any of their Pokémon due to lacking Sada's ID. Thus, the player uses their Koraidon, whose <a href=# title="Koraidon's Poké Ball">Poké Ball</a> has Sada's ID associated, to battle against the AI's Koraidon. Once the Paradise Protection Protocol has been defeated, the AI understands that the time machine cannot be shut down as long as it remains present to reboot the system, so it chooses to travel to the ancient past its creator had hoped to see, bidding farewell to the player and their friends as it disappears into the time machine.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=The_Indigo_Disk>The Indigo Disk</span></h3><p>If the player visits the <a href=# title="Crystal Pool">Crystal Pool</a> in <a href=# title=Kitakami>Kitakami</a> after catching <a href=# title="Terapagos (Pokémon)">Terapagos</a> and obtaining <a href=# title="Briar's Book">Briar's Book</a>, a Professor Sada that hadn't built a time machine will appear before them from a cloud of mist, with Koraidon being happy to see her again. She theorizes that she has somehow wound up there through space and time, possibly even from an alternate timeline. Talking with Sada reveals that she is still in the process of trying to create the time machine and hasn't seen her son Arven for quite some time. Noticing the player's copy of Briar's Book, Sada becomes fascinated by the information it contains regarding the <a href=# title="Area Zero Underdepths">Area Zero Underdepths</a> and offers to trade it for the <a href=# title="Scarlet Book">Scarlet Book</a> she had as a child, which the player agrees to, before the mist disappears and transports Sada back to where she came from.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h3><p>AI Sada's Pokémon are contained in <a href=# title="Master Ball">Master Balls</a>.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=First_battle>First battle</span></h4><table class=expandable cellspacing=1 cellpadding=2><tbody readability=0.79468960359013><tr><td><table cellspacing=1 cellpadding=2><tbody><tr><th width=80px height=80px><a href=# class=image><img alt=VSSada.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e2/VSSada.png/150px-VSSada.png decoding=async width=100 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></th><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td></td></tr><tr readability=1.5815548780488><td colspan=2></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Second_battle>Second battle</span></h4><p>Koraidon is given the title <b>the Guardian of Paradise</b> during the battle, and its HP is displayed similarly to a <a href=# title=Starmobile>Starmobile</a> or <a href=# title="Titan Pokémon">Titan Pokémon</a>.</p><p>As a scripted battle, the enemy Koraidon will always use <a href=# title="Taunt (move)">Taunt</a> on the first turn to prevent the player from using <a href=# title="Endure (move)">Endure</a> during the first three turns.
