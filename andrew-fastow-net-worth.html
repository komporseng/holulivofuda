He was ultimately fired after the company went bankrupt, leading to a criminal case. Despite this, his net worth is estimated to be around $500,000 as of early 2017. Fastow’s wealth significantly dropped due to the criminal case, during which it was revealed that he had defrauded tens of millions of dollars. However, there is potential for his net worth to increase as he continues his career.</p><p>Fastow’s journey in the business world began after he attended New Providence High School and then Tufts University, where he graduated with a degree in Economics and Chinese. His career took off when he worked at Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, and he later became involved with Enron Finance Corp in 1990.</p><p>As he became Chief Financial Officer of the company, he designed a web of companies that did business with Enron, but which was also used to hide losses of over $30 billion in their balance sheets. This led to his indictment on 78 counts, including conspiracy, money laundering, and fraud. He served a ten-year sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of wire and securities fraud, and became an informant for the authorities in the prosecution of other Enron executives, which led to a reduced sentence of six years. In 2011, he was released to a halfway house to serve the remainder of his sentence.</p><p>Fastow’s personal life also became embroiled in the scandal, with his wife, Lea Weingarten, being arrested for her involvement with Enron as an assistant treasurer. She served a year in a federal prison and a year of supervised release.</p><p>Now, his net worth is estimated at $500,000, a far cry from his previous success as a businessman. Despite his role in the Enron scandal and subsequent legal troubles, Fastow’s story has been covered in various books and he has made appearances in documentaries related to the Enron scandal.</p><p>**Structural Info:**<br>– Full Name: Andrew Fastow<br>– Net Worth: $500,000<br>– Date Of Birth: December 22, 1961<br>– Place Of Birth: Washington, D.C., United States<br>– Profession: Businessman<br>– Education: New Providence High School, Northwestern University, Tufts University, Kellogg School of Management<br>– Nationality: American<br>– Spouse: Lea Fastow<br>– Children: Jeffrey Fastow, Matthew Fastow<br>– Parents: Joan Fastow, Carl Fastow<br>– Siblings: Peter Fastow<br>– IMDB: [Andrew Fastow IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1876549/)</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiYp5yimsRussCsq6ivXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-cash-obituary-rollin-smoke-bbq-catering-llc-owner-and-ceo-has-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Cash Obituary, Rollin Smoke BBQ &amp;amp; Catering LLC Owner and CEO Has Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-unlock-every-ending.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Unlock Every Ending</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./luke-rodgers.html>Is English Footballer Luke Rodgers Married?
