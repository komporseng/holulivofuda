Fans of '' commented on her newest Instagram photo, wondering what happened between Devon and Matt.</p><p>Devon and Matt initially met in 2019, but their romance didn't take off until 2022 when he met her for the second time. She works as a loan officer for Summit Funding, Inc, and has two teenagers. Devon dated for five years following her divorce, but nothing worked out. Devon had been the subject of considerable conjecture about Matt's relationship, but he didn't divulge anything until 2022. When he fell in love with , he informed his mother &nbsp;that he was ready to take their relationship to the next level.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><h2 class=split>Did Devon and Matt break up?</h2><p>Over two seasons of dating his ex-fiancee Kimberly Cobb (who dumped him for Texas), Matt found a stopgap in Brittany until Devon provided him with the maternal presence (other than his own mother) he sought. Matt affirmed their connection, thanked his viewers, and in no uncertain terms confessed that he, Devon, and, most importantly, Kelly are ready for Season 4 by pinning an image to his Instagram on August 29, 2022, all dressed in black.</p><p>But things took an intriguing turn on March 16 when Devon posted an Instagram photo of herself posing extremely close to a new man. The man, identified as Craig Smalley, is also a parent to two children like Devon.</p><p>"Thank you @soldbycraig for putting this event together," Devon captioned the adding, "I ‚ù§Ô∏è making memories with you."</p><p>This has aroused some apprehensions among viewers and they have not been shy in raising them in response to her Instagram post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e9402ea4-5816-4fda-b174-c190aecd3aa6.png><h2 class=split>'She had to date him to get on the show'</h2><p>Fans quickly jumped on the bandwagon and raised some important questions in the . One of her followers wrote, "Ok yeah but we're going to need to hear more about what happened with you and Matt ü§£." While another quipped, "Wait no more mamas boy?? üëÄüëÄ."</p><p>Speaking of Matt and Devon both going quiet about each other on their respective social media platforms, another follower wrote, "I noticed y‚Äôall hadn‚Äôt posted each other in a while!!! Very interesting!" Another person bashed her and wrote, "She had to date him to get on the show and get some attention. We knew it wouldn't last!"</p><p>Sad to see the two didn't work out, a fan sighed, "No Matt this makes me sad üò¢." While others think, "Well that didn't last long üòÜ glad you üèÉüëèüëè."</p><p>Replying to one of the trolls, Devon also cleared the air about where she stands with Matt. She clapped back and wrote, "Maybe I should make my whole social media following from trashing someone I dated for a couple months? Nah‚Ä¶ not my style. But thanks for the follow but you can show yourself the door. üòâ."</p><p>Looks like fans are in for yet another interesting storyline for Matt next season.
