Chris Sharma is considered one of the greatest climbers in the history of the sport.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Chris Sharma was born Chris Omprakash Sharma on <strong>23rd April 1981.</strong> He stepped into this world in Santa Cruz, California, United States. With this, she is currently<strong> 42 years old</strong> and is American by nationality. Also, his birth date is Taurus and he follows Buddhism.</p><p>Moving on to his family members, he was born to her father Bob Sharma, and her mother Gita Jahn. His parents were huge followers of the popular yogi Baba Hari Dass. Therefore, they adopted the surname Sharma after they got married.</p><p>Similarly, Chris started climbing rocks at the age of 12 at the Pacific Edge climbing gym. In terms of his educational status, he went to Mount Madonna School and spent one year at Soquel High School.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life_and_Career>Professional Life and Career</span></h2><p>Sharma won the US Bouldering Nationals at the age of 14, and at the age of 15, he made the first ascent of Necessary Evil 5.14c (8c+) in the Virgin River Gorge, which was at the time the highest-rated climb in North America. He then relocated to Bishop, California, to climb The Mandala, a V12 boulder problem.</p><p>Similarly, he completed the extension of the 8c+ (5.14c) route Biographie in Ceüse, France, on July 18, 2001, and named it Realization; it was the world’s first consensus 9a+ (5.15a) route, and it has since become an iconic and important route in the history of the sport, ushering in a “technological revolution”.</p><p>He developed or completed routes at or above 5.15 (9b/+) in the following years, including La Rambla and Es Pontas (a deep-water soloing project in Mallorca).&nbsp;Likewise, he proposed a 5.15b (9b) grade for Jumbo Love, a 250-foot line (76 m) at Clark Mountain in California, in 2008. Chris is followed on several climbs throughout the world in the 2008 film King Lines, which includes his comments on his past, climbing, and life.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198823 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chris-climbing-in-the-rocks.jpg alt="Chris Sharma" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198823 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Chris Sharma climbing in the rocks (source: Outside Magazine)</p><h4>More Details</h4><p>Moving on, he remarked in 2013 that he felt something needed to change after Jumbo Love and that he had climbed routes established by others, including 5.15b, but felt his limitations had not been tested. He climbed several additional 5.15b routes (Golpe de Estado, Neanderthal, and Catxasa), each one a project in and of itself, to get a sense of what a route beyond these may feel like, and then began looking for climbs tougher than these that would “transform him” and had not yet been recognized.&nbsp;In 2007, he relocated to Lleida, a town in Catalonia, Spain, in the Spanish Pyrenees. He discovered the answer in the adjacent Oliana hard limestone cliffs, where he created multiple 5.14+ and 5.15 routes.</p><p>By 2013, Sharma had spent a significant amount of time attempting La Dura Dura, an Oliana climb he described as “horrifyingly” difficult and possibly “not for me,” and had formed a close bond with Adam Ondra, who was about 20 years old at the time and widely regarded as the next generation’s best climber. By working on routes with Ondra, Sharma was able to assist him, and Ondra felt driven to work more as a result. Sharma completed the ascent of La Dura Dura on March 23, 2013, just a few days before his 32nd birthday.</p><h4><span>Net Worth 2024</span></h4><p>The professional rock climber has made a pretty huge amount of wealth. According to online resources, his <strong>net worth</strong> is around $5 million US dollars.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Regarding his personal life, he is currently in a married relationship with his fiancee, <strong>Jimena Alarcón</strong>. They married each other in the year 2015. After living for many years in Oliana, Spain, he moved to Barcelona.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198829 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chris-with-his-wife-Jimena.jpg alt="Chris Sharma" width=650 height=754 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198829 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Chris Sharma with his wife Jimena (source: Celeb Doko)</p><h2><span id=Chris_Sharma_8211_Body_Measurements>Chris Sharma – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Enhancing his body measurements, Chris Sharma has maintained a fit body as a climber.
