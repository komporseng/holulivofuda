One of the 16 contestants appearing this season is Kyle Capener from Utah.</p><p>Read the full article to know about Kyle’s Big Brother 24 stint, his age, job, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Kyle Capener On Big Brother 24</strong></h3><p>In case you have forgotten how Big Brother works, let us give you a quick overview of the show. In the hit CBS show, a group of contestants referred to as “Houseguests” from all over the globe (most of them are from the US) come together to live in a specially constructed house far away from the outside world for a cash prize of $750,000. The contestants are 24/7 monitored using live TV cameras and personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, Houseguests are evicted from the house by being voted out. One to survive till the last wins the show.</p><p>The first live eviction episode of Big Brother 24 is scheduled for July 14th and unfortunately, Kyle Capaner is also in danger of being voted out of the show. As of this writing, only two out of 16 houseguests are safe–they are Head of Household winner Daniel Durston and Backstage Boss ticket holder Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli.</p><p>Ahead of the premiere of the show, Kyle talked to Parade.com a little about himself and a little about his strategies for the competition. When asked about the type of players he wants to avoid in his alliance, he replied, “Type-A dominant personalities that want to rule the house and dictate what happens in the alliance.” He revealed that he is a very chill guy and does not like conflict.</p><p>Kyle also talked a little about as to what the other houseguest may dislike about him. “So I’m the type of person that always makes light of every situation. If there are fights and quarrels, I’m the type of guy that tries to make a joke and make people laugh to feel better. That might rub people the wrong way when people are trying to play the game hard and be very serious,” Big Brother 24 star told.</p><p>Furthermore, Kyle shared that he received the best advice from his mom before coming out to play and it was “Just be yourself. Everybody else has already taken.”</p><h3><strong>Kyle Capener Height</strong></h3><p>Big Brother Season 24 star Kyle Capener stands tall at a towering height of 6 feet 3 inches.</p><h3><strong>Does Kyle Capener Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>According to heavy.com, Kyle Capener was single when he debuted on Big Brother 24.</p><p>On August 4, 2021, Kyle even uploaded a TikTok video to his Instagram answering all the questions he gets as a 28-year-old living with his parents.
