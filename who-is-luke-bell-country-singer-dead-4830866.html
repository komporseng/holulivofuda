His friend and fellow country singer, <strong>Matt Kinman</strong>, also confirmed the “heartbreaking” news to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Saving Country Music</a>. Almost a month later on Sept. 19, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC 9 KGUN Tucson</a> confirmed that the medical examiner ruled his death as being caused by “fentanyl intoxication.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find out more about Luke and his life below.</p><h2>He decided to pursue a music career when he was in college.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Luke-Bell-5-Things-Country-Star-Died-YT-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Luke was attending the University of Wyoming but decided to drop out and move to Austin, TX to try his hand at country music. He would perform at several honky-tonks and saloons in the area until he eventually did a short stint in New Orleans, LA, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Boot</a>. He went on to Wyoming before making his way to Nashville, TN, the country capital of the U.S.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Luke’s big break came when he was signed by Thirty Tigers in 2016 and released his self-titled album a year later.

Listen, half the time, I end up drinking beer with my neighbors. Life’s not that bad. The downside, in some ways, is I don’t have a wife and kids, but at the same time, it’s pretty ideal right now. I just travel around to other cities and hang out with other people… The goal is to have high hopes and low expectations and have a good time.”</p><h2>He reportedly suffered from bipolar disorder.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Luke’s friend Matt told The Boot that he was secretly battling a severe form of the disorder and he believes a recent change in his medication may have “played a role” in his disappearance and eventual death.

Despite this, he was unable to receive the help he needed to ease his pain.” In addition they told the outlet that their, “hearts go out to the millions of people affected by mental illness who, like us, understand the devastating disappointment of a system that consistently fails to provide caring solutions to those who suffer.”</p><h2>He appeared to be an animal lover.</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-12></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by Luke Bell (@lukebellmusic)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Luke shared several photos of animals on his Instagram page over the years.
